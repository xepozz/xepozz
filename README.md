### Hi there üëã

My name is Dmitry. 

At my free time I like to contribute [Yii3](https://github.com/yiisoft).

### Projects

#### Internal Mocker

Source: https://github.com/xepozz/internal-mocker

The package helps mock internal php functions as simple as possible.
This is easy way to mock such functions as: `time()`, `str_contains()`, `rand()`, etc.

#### Yii Dev Panel

Source: https://github.com/xepozz/yii-dev-panel (moved to [yiisoft/yii-dev-panel](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii-dev-panel))

It's an aggregated application based on React that helps you to both develop and debug Yii3 application.

The project will contain several application's frontends for Gii, Debug and Inspector modules.

#### Test It!

Source: https://github.com/xepozz/test-it

A tool for generating files with tests cases based on class methods signatures.

Great way to start tests writing. It will help you to have an addiction to write tests without doing routine tasks such as creating files, writing methods and test cases.

#### Blogit
