### Hi there 👋

My name is Dmitry. 

At my free time I like to contribute [Yii3](https://github.com/yiisoft).

### Projects

#### Yii Dev Panel

It's an aggregated application based on React that helps you to both develop and debug Yii3 application.

The project will contain several application's frontends for Gii, Debug and Inspector modules.

#### Test It!

Source: https://github.com/xepozz/test-it

A tool for generating files with tests cases based on class methods signatures.

Great way to start tests writing. It will help you to have an addiction to write tests without doing routine tasks such as creating files, writing methods and test cases.

#### Blogit

I wanted to start writing useful articles 📝 and that's why I had developed CMS based on Github Pages.

It's not maintained at the moment but you can develop your skills contibuting this project.
