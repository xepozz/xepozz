### Hi there 👋

My name is Dmitry. 

Currently, I'm living in Voronezh, Russian Federation 🇷🇺.

I like to contribute into open source project at free time. Currently, I prefer [Yii 3](https://github.com/yiisoft).

I want to start blogging 📝 and 
that's why I came up with my own CMS based on Github and Github Pages.

🤔 I'm looking for help with developing CMS so if you want to contribute you are welcome to https://github.com/xepozz/blogit
